# Pimp your Profile Checklist

- [ ] Personal readme
- [ ] Fill out metadata
- [ ] Archive or delete stale project

## Creating a Personal README
A good place to start is using the [profile readme generator](https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator). The way you add the readme to profile is to create a repository with your own name (e.g. KennethEnevoldsen) and then a button will appear in the upper right corner for you to add it to your profile.

## What is a Stale project?
A stale project is a project which content is boring. I.e. it is not something you believe is worth sharing. Typically though these project just needs to pimped up a bit.

# Pimp your Project

Does it have:
- [ ] Meaningful content
- [ ] README.md
- [ ] LICENSE.txt
- [ ] Good folder structure
- [ ] A good name
- [ ] A description

## What is a good repository name?
There is no strict rules here, but as all good titles it should describe the content and be memorable. This is probably the hardest part. The easiest part is following a convention. Typically GitHub repositories use "`-`" as space and lowercasing the entire title. E.g. [detecting-political-biases-using-sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/Detecting-Political-biases-using-sentiment-analysis).

## What is a good folder structure?
While there (again) is no hard rules there is some good guidelines out there. I would suggest using a standard outline and changing that as needed. Some popular examples include:

[Cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
[ProjectTemplate for R](https://github.com/KentonWhite/ProjectTemplate)
