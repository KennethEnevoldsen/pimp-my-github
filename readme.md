# ü§© Pimp my GitHub
This is a checklist on how to pimp your GitHub page. If you have a Github which need pimpin' be sure to stroll through the checklist to make sure you have checked out all the relevant points


# ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èPimp your Profile Checklist

Any properly pimped GitHub should naturally have:
- [ ] Personal readme (optional)
- [ ] metadata filled out
- [ ] no stale project
- [ ] relevantly starred project

##  Creating a Personal README
A good place to start is using the [profile readme generator](https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator). The way you add the readme to profile is to create a repository with your own name (e.g. KennethEnevoldsen) and then a button will appear in the upper right corner for you to add it to your profile.

## What is a Stale project?
A stale project is a project which content is boring. I.e. it is not something you believe is worth sharing. Typically though these project just needs to pimped up a bit.

## What projects are relevant?
Projects which you would be glad for your new employer to see as their first impression of you. Things you are proud of. Any relevant project should naturally fullfill the [Pimp your Project Checklist](pimp-your-project-checklist)


# üöÄ Pimp your Project Checklist

Any properly pimped GitHub project should naturally have:
- [ ] Meaningful content
- [ ] A pimped README.md
- [ ] A LICENSE.txt
- [ ] A good folder structure
- [ ] A good name
- [ ] A description
- [ ] No junk files

## What is a good repository name?
There is no strict rules here, but as all good titles it should describe the content and be memorable. This is probably the hardest part. The easiest part is following a convention. Typically GitHub repositories use "`-`" as space and lowercasing the entire title. E.g. [detecting-political-biases-using-sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/Detecting-Political-biases-using-sentiment-analysis).

## What is a good folder structure?
While there (again) is no hard rules there is some good guidelines out there. I would suggest using a standard outline and changing that as needed. Some popular examples include:

- [Cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
- [ProjectTemplate for R](https://github.com/KentonWhite/ProjectTemplate)
- [niceRcode](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/)

Or steal what you find useful. This is to make it easier for you not harder.

## What is a junk file
Junk files are typically temporary files or files which clearly indicate lack of structure. E.g. having the scripts `Analysis1.rmd`, `Analysis2.rmd` and `Analysis2_final.rmd` indicate this. It makes it also makes it hard for you to find what you are looking for when going back. Junk files also include files which does not need to be shared (or worse shouldn't e.g. due to privacy). Examples of these include the `.Rproj` files.

# üåÖ Pimp your README Checklist

Any properly pimped README should naturally have:
- [ ] Properly formatted headings
- [ ] A visualization, e.g. image or gif
- [ ] relevant shields
- [ ] a project name and intro (and potentially a logo)
- [ ] an explanation of why the project is relevant
- [ ] A "getting started/requirements/dependencies" section
- [ ] Contact information e.g. using Social Icons
- [ ] A todo/known limitaitons/bugs
- [ ] Use visual hints appropriately
- [ ] <s>A table of content</s>

A good source for inspiration is [this list](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) of awesome readmes.

## Properly formatted headings and tables of content
GitHub automatically created a table of content based on your heading. It is thus relevant to use reasonable headings.

Headings generally follow a an overall structure somewhat like this:
```
# Project Name

# Introduction
Describe very briefly but clearly what the project does and why does it exist?

# Getting Started/Requirements/Prerequisites/Dependencies
How to install it, or what packages is used for it (any notable dependencies)

# Acknowledgements/Thank you

# TODOs/Next steps/Features planned

# Contact
```

This roughly follows [Zalando's readme template](https://github.com/zalando/zalando-howto-open-source/blob/master/READMEtemplate.md#readme).

## Including vizualisations
Examples of visualization includes tables, images, and gifs.

### Images
Images in the readme is very useful, but they should typically be used sparsely.

Images and gifs can be included using the following syntax:

Using a markdown syntax
```
![](img/your_image.png)
```

or using HTML:
```
<div align="center"><img src="img/your_image.png"/></div>
```

Generally the HTML is more customizeable.

### Gifs
Gifs is a great way to show interactions with software and they are quite easy to make. Use your favorite video capturing software (on macOS you can use `CMD+shift+5`) and then use an [online converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com) to convert it to a GIF.


### Tables
Tables can be made in markdown using the following syntax. However, unless it is a very simple table I would use a script for creating the table as an image (e.g. using `kableExtra` in R) for creating and image and inserting that instead as it typically allows for more flexibility.  

```
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
```
would produce the following table:
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

## Shield
A [shield](https://shields.io) is meta data denoting symbol. These look quite fancy but are very useful for denoting simple information. E.g. the Python version used:

[![describtor - e.g. python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Version->=3.6-blue)](www.desired_reference.com)

which is produced using the following:
```
[![describtor - e.g. python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Version->=3.6-blue)](www.desired_reference.com)
```

You will note that this look very similar to inserting an image. That is because it is exactly that:
```
# adding image:
![](LINK_TO_IMAGE)

# adding clickable image with a link
[![](LINK_TO_IMAGE)](YOUR_DESIRED_LINK)
```

The only read trick is the link. Which is basically your desired text as an URL in a two block format, followed by a color: `MY TEXT-TEXT-COLOR`
```
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/MY%20TEXT-TEXT-green)
```
which produces:

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/MY%20TEXT-TEXT-green)


These can be automated quite a bit. E.g. if you publish a package you can have it read the package and software versions from the package publications. You can read more about shields in the shields [website](https://shields.io). 

## *"Getting Started"*-section
The getting started section. typically include how to download the project and install relevant package. This section is the section which allow people (mostly yourself) to redo the analysis or use parts of it later.

For most R project this is not really something which people are in the habit of doing, but for python projects it is highly used. Any good python project have a `requirements.txt` which indicate the required packages (and potentially their versions number). In R you can do something similar. After you have run the script you can use:

```r
sessionInfo()
```

```bash
R version 2.15.0 (2012-03-30)
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

locale:
[...]

attached base packages:
[1] graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  stats     grid      methods   base     

other attached packages:
[1] ggplot2_0.9.0  reshape2_1.2.1 plyr_1.7.1    

[...]
```

I highly recommend always attaching this to a project as this make it possible for you to see why something which previously worked doesn't work anymore.

This section should also include other potential things you need to install. It is probably relevant to note here that code can be included in markdown using the backticks:
```
single line code can be included using a single backtick: `2+2`

while multiple lines of code can be included using three backticks e.g. (exlude the #)
#```python
#for i in range(10):
#    pass 
#```
```

The `python` here denote the syntax highlighting (the coloration of the text) which would make the resulting code more readable:

```python
for i in range(10):
    pass 
```

## Contact information and Icons
Every page should include contact information, even if it is just a reference to the issues section. However you can pimp these up quite easily using icons. This is very similar to using shields so read that section first.

Again we want to create a clickable image:
```
[![](LINK_TO_IMAGE)](LINK_ON_CLICK)

if you want a bit more control of the size:
[<img align="left" alt="Hover over text" width="22px" src="LINK_TO_IMAGE" />][ref]

</details>

[ref]: LINK_ON_CLICK
```

E.g. including a twitter icon could look something like this:
```
[<img align="left" alt="KCEnevoldsen | Twitter" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/twitter.svg" />][twitter]


</details>

[twitter]: https://twitter.com/KCEnevoldsen
```

[<img align="left" alt="KCEnevoldsen | Twitter" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/twitter.svg" />][twitter]


<br />
<br />

Again here the link is really the magic, one simply need to change the `twitter.svg` part to get a new image. For full list of possible images you can check out [simpleicons](https://simpleicons.org). One could for instance use `itunes.svg`.

<img align="left" alt="My playlist | Itunes" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/itunes.svg" />

</details>

[twitter]: https://twitter.com/KCEnevoldsen

## Using visual hints
Using visual hints is a powerful tool to guide attention and adding these can be quite easy. For instance emoji can be used for section header to make them quickly skimmable e.g. using üéì for reference or üîß for installations. You can naturally also use icons or similar for this.

Other visual hints could also include other elements such as drop down menus:
<details>
<summary>A drop down menu!</summary>
<br>
This is a useful feature for hiding long content (e.g. the output of `sessionInfo`). These can be inserted using some simple HTML:

```
<details>
<summary>A drop down menu!</summary>
<br>
Some very very very long content you want to hide.

</details>
```

if you want to dropdown menu to start open you can use:

```
<details open>
```

</details>

## The *"Known limitations"*-section
This is basically just the part where you include known bugs. Or potentially things you could have improved. During development you typically see these take the form of a todo list. E.g.

- [x] Create a nice radme
- [x] add a project description
- [ ] do the analysis

Which you can create using:

```
- [x] Create a nice radme
- [x] add a project description
- [ ] do the analysis
```


# Making meaningful content from an Assignment

Typically most of you start out with only assignments as your GitHub content. These can however be very impressive GitHubs, but I will offer a few extra tips here.

- 1. Include and add reference to the final product (PDFs can be viewed on GitHub)
- 2. Include a short summary (e.g. your abstract)
- 3. Include meaningful plots and tables which support your conclusions
- 4. Make this readable for non-cogsci students (who haven't seen the assignment beforehand)
- 5. focus on why it is relevant. This is typically a things left out in assignment type githubs. Where people list what they did, but forget to mention why they did it. Here you could also add what you would change if you were to do it for real. 

# Stealing from other people readmes
This is probably the best trick. You see something you like? Copy it and do the same. How do you do this?

Go to the desired readme -> Find and click the readme -> Press the "edit" pen or the "raw" button -> find and copy what you like


<!-- 
# How to readme
- Heading
- check boxes
- code, bold, italic, links, images
- hyperlinks
- HTML
  - centering
